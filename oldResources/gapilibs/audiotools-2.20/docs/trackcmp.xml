  <description>
    trackcmp takes two audio tracks and compares their PCM data.
    If they are exactly the same, it prints no output and returns 0.
    If not, a message is displayed and 1 is returned.

    trackcmp may also take two directories as arguments.
    In that case, any audio files in both directories are compared
    as per a single file.
    Track and album numbers are used to determine which file
    should be compared to which.
