/*The bitstream reader operates on jump tables that have been
  compiled from the original Huffman tree.

  Using this module as a standalone binary,
  one can compile JSON source into jump tables suitable
  for importing into C code.  For example, given the JSON file:

  [[1], 0,
   [0, 1], 1,
   [0, 0, 1], 2,
   [0, 0, 0], 3]

  We compile it to a jump table with:

  % huffman -i table.json > table.h

  where "table.h" is imported in source code with:

  struct br_huffman_table table[][0x200] =
  #include "table.h"
  ;

  and called from the bitstream reader with:

  value = bitstream->read_huffman_code(bitstream, table);

  This is the preferred method of handling static Huffman trees
  which are the same for every file in a particular format.


  However, for Huffman trees which are defined at runtime,
  one will need to compile the jump table directly.
  For example, given a set of frequency values:

  struct huffman_frequency frequencies[] = {
      {1, 1, 0},  // bits = 1      value = 0
      {1, 2, 1},  // bits = 0 1    value = 1
      {1, 3, 2},  // bits = 0 0 1  value = 2
      {0, 3, 3}}  // bits = 0 0 0  value = 3
     };

  we compile them to a table with:

  struct br_huffman_table (*table)[][0x200];
  compile_br_huffman_table(&table, frequencies, 4, BS_BIG_ENDIAN);

  and call that table from the bitstream reader with:

  value = bitstream->read_huffman_code(bitstream, *table);

  before finally deallocating the table with:

  free(table);

  For real code, the "frequencies" array will be allocated at runtime
  but can be deallocated immediately once "table" has been compiled.
  In addition, real code will want to check the return value of
  "compile_br_huffman_table" in case of an incorrectly specified Huffman tree.
