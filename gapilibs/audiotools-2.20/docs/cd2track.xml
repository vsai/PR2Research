    <p>
      Extracted tracks are automatically verified against
      AccurateRip's online database.
      The confidence level is the number of other people
      who have the same rip, so a larger value indicates
      one's own rip is consistent with those of others.
      However, not finding one's rip in the AccurateRip
      database does not necessarily mean the rip is bad;
      the CD may be new, rare, or a different
      pressing than the one in the database.
