"""Samplerate is a small python package to do high quality audio resampling for
data in numpy arrays; IOW, it is a matlab resample replacement.

Samplerate is a wrapper around the Secret Rabbit Code from Erik de Castro Lopo
(http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/), which has high quality converters based on the
work of J.O Smith from CCRMA (see
http://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/resample/optfir.pdf)
